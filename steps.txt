Here’s how I suggest we build step by step:

Step 1️⃣ – Project Setup

Create Next.js 15 app with App Router.

Install TailwindCSS 4, Prisma, NextAuth (beta), PostgreSQL client.

Configure database schema (User model with role field).

Step 2️⃣ – Hero Page

Add a simple landing page with intro text.

Navbar with Login and Register buttons on top-right.

Step 3️⃣ – Auth Pages

Login & Register pages with forms.

Setup NextAuth with:

Credentials provider (email/password).

GitHub OAuth provider.

Prisma adapter for NextAuth.

Role field in user table.

Step 4️⃣ – Protect Routes

Middleware to restrict access:

/dashboard/user → only for role = USER.

/dashboard/admin → only for role = ADMIN.

Step 5️⃣ – Dashboards

User: profile update form.

Admin: CRUD for users.
